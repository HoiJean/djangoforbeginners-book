# Conclusion

Congratulations on finishing *Django for Beginners*! After starting from absolute zero we've now built four different web applications from scratch. And we've covered the major features of Django: templates, views, urls, users, models, security, testing, and deployment. You now have the knowledge to go off and build your own modern websites with Django.

As with any new skill, it's important to practice and apply what you've just learned. The CRUD functionality in our *Blog* app is common in many, many other web applications. For example, can you make a Todo List web application? You already have all the tools you need.

Web development is a very deep field. There's still much more to learn and Django has tons of additional built-in functionality we've yet to use. Large production Django projects often employ additional features that we haven't covered in this book:

* custom user models ([highly recommended in the official docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/auth/customizing/#using-a-custom-user-model-when-starting-a-project))
* multiple settings files
* custom user authentication flow
* adding [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for improved styling
* using ForeignKeys to link multiple database models
* authorization
* and more...

The follow-up to this book, **Intermediate Django**, walks through building a production-ready Twitter clone using these advanced features. It is the second in my three-part series on web development with Django: **Django for Beginners**, **Intermediate Django**, and **Advanced Django**.

Sign up for the [Django for Beginners newsletter](http://eepurl.com/cRL-aP) for updates on new content and discounts on future books.

My personal website [wsvincent.com](https://wsvincent.com/) is also regularly updated and features articles on some of these advanced techniques already:

* [Django Social Authentication](https://wsvincent.com/django-allauth-tutorial/)
* [Django Login Mega-Tutorial](https://wsvincent.com/django-allauth-tutorial-custom-user-model/)
* [Django, PostgreSQL, and Docker](https://wsvincent.com/django-docker-postgresql/)
* [Django Rest Framework Tutorial](https://wsvincent.com/django-rest-framework-tutorial/)
* [Django Rest Framework with React](https://wsvincent.com/django-rest-framework-react-tutorial/)

Finally I have just open-sourced [DjangoX](https://github.com/wsvincent/djangox), which is a framework for launching new Django projects quickly. It comes with out-of-the-box support for a custom user model, social authentication, Bootstrap v4, signup and login with email/password instead of Django's default username/email/password, and more. These topics will be covered in **Advanced Django** alongside building an e-commerce website with payments.


## Django Resources
To continue learning Django, I recommend working through the following free online tutorials:

* [Official Polls Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/)
* [Django Girls Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/)
* [MDN: Django Web Framework](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django)
* [A Complete Beginner's Guide to Django](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/2017/09/04/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-django-part-1.html)

I also strongly recommend [Two Scoops of Django 1.11: Best Practices for the Django Web Framework](http://amzn.to/2tE8LaT), which is the current best-practices bible for Django developers.


## Python Books
If you're new to Python, there are several excellent books available for beginners to advanced Pythonistas:

* [Python Crash Course](http://amzn.to/2okggMH) is a fantastic introduction to Python that also walks you through three real-world projects, including a Django application.
* [Think Python](http://amzn.to/2G1Xwvn) introduces Python and computer science fundamentals at the same time.
* [Automate the Boring Stuff](http://amzn.to/2DmRGmn) is another great guide to learning and using Python in real-world settings.
* [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://amzn.to/2DpJtxH) covers best practices in Python programming.
* [Python Tricks](http://amzn.to/2G4A5S8) demonstrates how to write Pythonic code.
* [Effective Python](http://amzn.to/2nCqivT) is an excellent guide not just to Python but programming in general.
