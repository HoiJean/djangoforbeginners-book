Congratulations on finishing _Django for Beginners_! We've now covered all the major features of Django: templates, views, urls, users, models, foreign keys, security, testing, and deployment.

There is still however much more to learn about Django and web development in general. I'm at work on a second, follow-up book <a href="http://intermediatedjango.com/" target="\_blank">Intermediate Django</a> that moves on from the basics. It will cover a host of additional topics in detail that are commonly used in real-world Django projects. It also will walk through building two new web applications--an e-commerce store with payments and a social photo app similar to Instagram that supports image uploads.

If you'd like to be updated when this current book is complete and for updates on the new book, please [sign up for the Django for Beginners newsletter](http://eepurl.com/cRL-aP).

## Django Resources

To continue learning Django, I recommend working through the following free online tutorials:

* [Official Polls Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/)
* [Django Girls Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/)

* [A Complete Beginner's Guide to Django](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/2017/09/04/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-django-part-1.html)

There are also two books that I strongly recommend to anyone interested in Django:

* [Two Scoops of Django 1.11: Best Practices for the Django Web Framework](http://amzn.to/2tE8LaT) is the current bible for best practices in Django.
* [Test-Driven Development with Python](http://amzn.to/2f3NH7j) is a robust introduction to Django and Python testing.
